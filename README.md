# ðŸ“˜ TypeScript for React â€“ Learning Repository

This repository contains all my notes, exercises, and source code as I go through a **TypeScript for React** course.  
The goal is to gain hands-on experience using TypeScript in React projects â€” from typing props and state to working with hooks, contexts, and more advanced patterns.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered (in progress)
- TypeScript fundamentals for React
- Typing props and components
- Working with `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks
- Typing context and reducers
- Type-safe forms and events
- Advanced patterns and best practices

## ðŸš€ Purpose
This repo is meant as a personal learning sandbox â€” code will be structured by topic or lesson, and may include both working and experimental examples.

> ðŸ“Œ **Note**: Contributions are not expected, but feedback is always welcome.
